# OpenHex
This is a game using a hexagonal grid, based on the game "Hexagonos" for the Sega Genesis.
It uses jME 3.1

## To do list:
 - Ainimations (required to see what AI did)
 - Settings (optional)
 - Non-crappy graphics
 - Maybe some cleanup for the Nifties (looks confusing)
 - A popup at the end that says who won
 - Publish the game + binary
 - Android (for publishing)
